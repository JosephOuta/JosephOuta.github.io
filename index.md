<!-- ### __Joseph Outa__ -->

Hello. Iâ€™m Joseph. I am a research coordinator for the <a href = "http://sll.stanford.edu/research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Learning Lab</a> with Prof. Hyowon Gweon at Stanford University. 

I graduated from Cornell University in 2020 with a B.A. in Biology and Society. In the years following my graduation, I developed an interest in cognitive science and developmental psychology. I worked as a research assistant with Prof. Tobi Gerstenberg at the <a href = "https://cicl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Causality in Cognition Lab</a>, Prof. Mike Frank at the <a href = "http://langcog.stanford.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language and Cognition Lab</a> at Stanford University and Prof. Laura Niemi at the <a href = "https://lauraniemi.com/lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Moral Psychology Lab</a> at Cornell University. I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya.

I am interested in our developing intuitive understanding of the physical and social world. I ask questions like how does our knowledge of objects and agents emerge and how do we distinguish these categories? How do we build our knowledge of the world both as individual learners and as agents embedded in a social world? How abstract or concrete is our developing knowledge in different domains, and how might this be revealed in the kinds of explanations we endorse? 

I am also interested in science communication. I co-host the <a href = "https://www.stanfordpsychologypodcast.com/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanford Psychology Podcast</a> where we invite leading psychologists to share their most recent work. Here are some examples of guests I have interviewed: <a href = "https://podcasts.apple.com/es/podcast/61-chaz-firestone-melting-ice-with-your-mind/id1574802514?i=1000578062671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaz Firestone</a>, <a href = "https://podcasts.apple.com/br/podcast/40-ashley-thomas-how-children-use-saliva-sharing-to/id1574802514?i=1000556551754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Thomas</a>, <a href = "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/63-anne-scheel-why-most-psychological-research-findings/id1574802514?i=1000579611325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Scheel</a>, <a href = "https://podcasts.apple.com/sk/podcast/52-jay-van-bavel-the-power-of-us/id1574802514?i=1000568346780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay Van Bavel</a>.
