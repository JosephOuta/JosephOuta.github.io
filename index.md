Our lab aims to understand the ingredients of intelligence. We use advances in machine intelligence to better understand human intelligence, and use insights from human intelligence to develop more fruitful kinds of machine intelligence.

There have been remarkable recent advances in machine learning and AI. Computers have beaten Jeopardy champions, defeated Go masters, driven autonomous cars, and shattered records for object and speech recognition. Progress has been impressive, yet today's AI provides nothing like the general purpose intelligence that we have as humans. 
Human minds solve a diverse array of computational problems that stump the best machines: learning new concepts, learning new tasks, understanding scenes, forming explanations, amongst many others. Machines also struggle to simulate other facets of human intelligence, including creativity, curiosity, self-assessment, and commonsense reasoning.
