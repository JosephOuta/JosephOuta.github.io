While a research assistant with Prof. Mike Frank, I had the opportunity to audit his <a href = "https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?academicYear=20182019&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=PSYCH%20251%3A%20Experimental%20Methods&view=catalog#:~:text=Graduate%20laboratory%20class%20in%20experimental,the%20ethical%20conduct%20of%20research.">Psych 251: Experimental Methods class.</a> Our final project assignment was to attempt to replicate a finding from a randomly selected paper in psychology. We had just learnt about the open science movement so this was an exciting chance to experience the notorious challenges of replication Iâ€™d heard so much about; where would I get the data and analysis scripts? Would the code be readable? How would I know it was successful? I chose two target effects from study 5 of <a  href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618805750">Cao, Kleiman-Weiner & Banaji (2019)</a>, preregistered and ran it on Amazon Mturk and analyzed the data. The replication was partially successful: the two-tailed t-test was replicated whereas only the main effects of the ANOVA were replicated. <a href = "https://rpubs.com/joouta/700018">Here</a> is a report summarizing the project.
