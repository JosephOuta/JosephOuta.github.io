How does the ability to integrate multi-modal information develop in early childhood? We probe this using the plinko task, a simple and intuitive way to assess children’s physical reasoning based on multi-modal evidence. It consists of a box which is occluded while a ball is dropped into one of three holes, producing sounds as it hits the obstacles and lands in the sand at the bottom. Participants are then asked in which hole the ball was dropped. How do adults solve this task? Prior work suggests they integrate visual and auditory information through mental simulation of the physical dynamics of the scene.

What about children? We compare their responses with predictions of four computational models: random guessing, a simple matching heuristic, visual simulation, and visual & auditory simulation. We found that random guessing was very rare. Instead, younger children's responses were more consistent with matching (choosing the hole that's closest to where the ball landed). Additionally, children’s responses were increasingly consistent with the predictions of the mental simulation models, especially between 6 to 8 years of age. This work shows how children's capacity to draw causal inferences based on visual and auditory information develops, and how computational models can help us look underneath the veil of chance performance, providing deeper and richer insights into how children think.
